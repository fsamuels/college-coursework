This directory contains files for creating a wormGame with easily
modifyable game objects.


Level.h,Level.cpp - the Level class; controls what happens on the actual
   "playing field" for each level of the game

Level_mods.cpp - member functions of Level that need to be modified when
   new objects are added to the level.
 
Level_old.cpp - old version of Level.cpp (do a diff to see what has changed)

String.h,String.cpp - the String class (homegrown)

Worm.h,Worm.cpp - the Worm class (a solution to 6_HW in case you want to
   see one way to do it); only responsible for drawing and movement of the
	worm.

WormSegment.h,WormSegment.cpp - the WormSegment class, same as in 6_HW

gameDefs.h - global constants (some new ones have been added to eliminate
   "magic numbers" from the code)

makefile - compiles the wormGame program (be sure you're on Solaris 2.6)

sxwin.h,sxwin.cpp - the sxwin class (with some additions and modifications)

sys_utils.h - two simple classes to handle timing and random numbers

wormGame - sample executable

wormGame.cpp - main program for the game
