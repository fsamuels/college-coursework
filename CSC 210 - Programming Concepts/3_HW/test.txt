Curing Online Music Piracy at Universities

	Disregard for copyright laws has become a serious problem in our society, and music piracy is one of the more prevalent instances of this. Specifically, online music piracy is running rampant at universities around the United States. There are many causes of online music piracy such as economics, apathy, a lack of enforcement, and inexpensive technology. The problem of online music piracy; however, can not be solved by simply eliminating the causes. Other solutions must be examined. Understanding the causes and extent of this problem is necessary to formulate a viable solution.
	There are many causes of online music piracy at universities. The most substantial causes are economics, apathy, a lack of enforcement, and inexpensive technology. Economics is a big factor. Most students are on limited budgets and free music that is easily downloaded from the Internet is just as good as the CD that would have cost them fifteen dollars. One student from the University of Washington who is heavily involved with the online music community said, "[piracy] appeals to teenagers and college students, and basically it's a matter of money. We don't have much; and if we can get the music we like for free, then we're going to do it (Lange, 2)."Students do not seem to feel guilty about possessing pirated music either. They are either ignorant or apathetic when it comes to copyright laws. Ignorance can also be attributed to the lack of enforcement. Students will continue to engage in piracy if they do not realize they are committing a crime in the first place. Until recently, no one searched for copyright violations and getting caught by the university did not mean much more then a loss of network connections in your room for a few weeks or a semester.
The most important of the causes is inexpensive technology that makes piracy possible at all. Computers are becoming more economical everyday making it possible for most college students have computers in their dorm rooms. Almost all of those computers are also connected to the Residential Network known as ResNet. ResNet connections are fifty to sixty times faster than a dial up modem connection, and they allow students to transfer a mass of music quickly and easily from the comfort of their own dorm rooms. Large, inexpensive hard disk drives allow students to store a large number of songs on their computer and with Recordable CD-ROM drives (CD-R Drives), storage space almost becomes insignificant. A two-dollar CD can store well over 100 songs. However, the biggest technology factor that has allowed online music piracy to flourish is the invention of the MP3. MP3 is a new file format that compresses audio 12 times smaller then previous audio formats making it easier to store and quickly transfer CD quality music. There are also numerous utilities that allow the creation and playback of MP3s, almost all of which are free and easily downloadable from the Internet. MP3s are certainly a "dream format for piracy." (Cavenett, 39)
Online music piracy at universities is a very big deal and a very big problem. It is so big at universities in fact that a majority of sites on the Internet that distribute pirated music are run from college dorm rooms, according to Kris Henderson, a software-engineering student who runs a very popular site which provides links to such pirated music (Lange, 2). Universities across the United States are finding themselves plagued with students who have and distribute illegal copies of music over the Internet. The universities are also finding themselves potentially plagued with lawsuits from the recording industry if they do not do something about their students conduct (Schmidt). Lawsuits by the recording industry are a big problem for the universities, but they are not the biggest problem of online piracy. Online piracy also consumes large amounts of the university network such as disk space and bandwidth slowing down service for all users (Pelliccia). Stanford University even found once that one student's site was consuming eighty percent of the network's bandwidth (Steinberg, 240). By far the biggest problem with online music piracy is the cost to record labels and musicians. When people can simply download music for free they are not going to go out and pay fifteen dollars for the CD. Online music piracy attributes to a very large percentage of the billion dollars lost annually in the United States due to music piracy (Cavenett, 39). With such a loss in revenue, record companies have found that they have to fight piracy themselves.
The problem of online music piracy at universities is a complex one that can not be stopped with just one or two simple steps and will likely continue regardless of the efforts of any group. Simply eliminating all the causes also will not stop it. Students will continue to be poor and apathetic. Online music piracy can, however, be reduced greatly by limiting bandwidth, taking steps to enhance MP3 technology, allowing for a legal avenue for digital music, and taking more legal steps against piracy. Limiting bandwidth is an idea that would not stop distribution of pirated music over university networks but it would slow distribution down. If students in dorm rooms were not able to transfer data much faster than a modem user, transferring pirated music would become very time consuming and less desirable. It would also slow down distribution because transferring files would simply take a lot longer. This method does, however, have more drawbacks then the other two proposed solutions because reducing bandwidth would affect people who were not using their connection to distribute pirated music also. 
Fighting technology with technology could be one of the best ways to hamper music piracy. The recording industry and other companies who will possibly profit from the sale of digital music have already formed coalitions to develop new standards for digital audio. These standards will also provide record companies with the extra benefit of allowing them a way to make money from digital music rather than loosing it. These new standards would contain "watermarks" that would identify legal copies of digital music. Rick Fleischman, a senior marketing director for Liquid Audio who is a member of one of the recent coalitions said, "We're trying to enable consumers to distinguish between pirated content and authorized content. We're taking a step here." He also says that this will be an effective way to slow distribution of pirated music since "most people, when given the opportunity to do so, won't take pirated things." (Ward)
Other watermarking technologies take a more offensive approach to stop music piracy. One such technology, known as M4, is the next generation of audio-compression technology that is being backed by Sony Electronics and Creative Labs. "M4 has a watermarking technology ... that can stop a second copy from being made," according to Creative's audio product marketing manager Micah Stroud (Olenick and Kenedy, 2). Other groups such as the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) have been formed to create their own standard that they hope will become more popular than MP3 and allow them to make money from digital music (Cavenett, 39). If a technology like M4 becomes the popular audio format, then MP3s may just slowly die out and take online music piracy in its current form with it. Watermarking technology is a step in the right direction to stop online music piracy, but it is a long-term solution and more action needs to be taken to stop piracy now.
Online piracy can not be stopped without better laws, much better enforcement and more severe penalties. Numerous copyright laws have been updated and also created in the last several years to cover digital mediums such as digital music. One of these laws, known as the No Electronic Theft ("NET") Act, was signed into law in December of 1997 (Oregon). It allows for criminal prosecution of infringement cases even if the distribution is not for profit (Soundbyting). Another major law passed recently is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) which allows the record companies to send informational subpoenas to Internet service providers and universities to help them find the identity of people who are distributing pirated music (Pelliccia). Both of these laws are being used more to find and prosecute distributors of pirated music. More related laws need to be passed to make it easier to convict and heavily fine music pirates. Unfortunately, these new laws are not being used nearly enough since online music piracy is still a large problem. More enforcement is needed to stop repeat offenders and to help deter students from even starting to collect or distribute pirated music in the first place. If students see that they will be caught, they are less likely to do something.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has made one of its main goals to try and stop music piracy in all forms, especially online piracy. Recently the group has used its power given to it by the DMCA to send letters to about 300 colleges and universities warning them that they could be sued if they did not do something about students who use university networks to distribute pirated music. "In targeting the universities, the RIAA might well staunch much of the flow of pirated MP3s-the majority of pirated music is currently traded on university servers," according to one recent news article (BROWN).
Even the recent actions taken by the RIAA fall short because of weak penalties. One of the schools that recently received a letter from the RIAA was Carnegie Mellon University. Carnegie Mellon took action and found that seventy-one students had copyright protected music available for public download on their university network. The associate dean of student affairs at the university, Paul Fowler, said, "There was a bit of uproar. The fact that the university had not actively enforced these policies up to this point caught a lot of students off guard." Their punishment proved to be about as harsh as their previous enforcement. The seventy-one students only lost their network connections for the rest of the semester, and if they took an hour and a half class on copyright infringement they would only loose their connection for a month (Schmidt). Although the crackdown is a good thing, the punishment from it continues to show students that they will only get a slap on the wrist when it comes to getting caught for music piracy. Another example is of the first person to be convicted under the NET Act, a University of Oregon Senior, who was distributing over seventy thousand dollars of pirated music from his dorm room. Although he faced up to three years in prison and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fines (Oregon), he only received two years of probation and restricted Internet access (Knight). More strict penalties need to be enforced. Students need to be made examples to show others that distributing pirated music will not be tolerated. 
The most effective method of fighting music piracy by the RIAA so far has been lawsuits. The head of the RIAA's anti-piracy unit, Frank Creighton said it best:

The educational steps we were taking with universities and the people posting these sites was only doing so much. Even the cease-and-desist letters we were sending were only so effective. So we had to go to litigation. We needed to send a stronger message to say, 'We mean business.' (Lange, 2)

Civil lawsuits are often more prevalent than criminal prosecutions in copyright infringement cases, and the costs from a civil lawsuit are far more then the fines associated with a criminal case.
	Online music piracy at universities can doubtfully be eliminated completely and will surely take time to be reduced significantly, but it can be done. The costs of implementing these solutions are very little in comparison to the billion dollars lost by the recording industry yearly. Steps are already being taken to create a better digital format such as M4 that would also benefit the recording industry by giving them a copyright safe method of selling digital music. Until then the RIAA and other groups should continue to crackdown and crackdown hard on music pirates. If these steps are taken, and given time, online music piracy will no longer be the problem it is today.
